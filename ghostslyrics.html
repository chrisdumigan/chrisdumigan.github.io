<h1>Ghosts</h1>
<h3>Music and Lyrics by Chris Dumigan</h3>
<p>
I want to go back,<br>
Back to those days.<br>
That I thought would never end,<br>
That I thought would never end.<br><br>
Listening, they haunt me now.<br>
More than  they ever did then,<br>
More than  they ever did then,<br><br>
And I listen and smile with a sadness.<br>
Knowing that they've gone forever<br>
Never to return<br>
And all the people that were part of it,<br>
Will never be together in the same place again.<br><br>
Ever<br>
For all time to come.<br><br>
As the tunes float across my ears they capture me.<br>
And the magic returns,<br>
And the magic returns.<br><br>
And I want to go back,<br>
Back to those days.<br>
That we thought would never end<br>
That we thought would never end.
</p>
