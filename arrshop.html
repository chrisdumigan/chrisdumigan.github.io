<p><b>Foreword</b></p>
<p>At last! For all those classical guitarists who long to play the famous pop songs of the past — a worthy collection arranged by Chris Dumigan. Suitable for any intermediate player to read through and take a trip down memory lane or, for the advanced guitarist to enjoy, perform or use as a basis for further improvisation.</p>
<p>Chris Dumigan's arrangements do not fall into the familiar traps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ludicrously difficult and awkward arrangements that just don't work.</li>
<li>Over-simplified arrangements that leave out all the good bits other than the basic tune.</li>
<li>Dry ‘academic’ arrangements, unplayable due to their resulting 'unguitaristic' and unimaginative scoring.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are left with highly 'playable' polyphonic arrangements that are presented in an honest and reliable form. The chosen keys allow the music to sound at it’s very best on the classical guitar.</p>
<p>Chris Dumigan's love of these songs and his own joy at realizing them on his own guitar shine though every note.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p><b>Foreword</b></p>
<p>Well, here it is! Once again I have arranged ten songs from all musical walks of life for classical guitar in the hope that players will get much pleasure out of them, and hope that they will ﬁnd some use in any number of musical environments, Whether they are private or public.</p>
<p>The music ranges from Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? from the days of the depression, to Show songs such as Memory (Cats) and Feed the Birds (Mary Poppins). Also covered here is film music We Have All the Time in the World (On Her Majesty’s Secret Service) and the haunting harmonics of Women of Ireland, used to spectacular effect in Barry Lyndon as originally played by the Chieftains. Finally there is a smattering of classic pop/rock melodies such as Cyndi Lauper's Time After Time and Brian Wilson's God Only Knows.</p>
<p>I do hope you enjoy them.</p>

<p>These three pieces were originally written as a private commission, and so have never been publicly performed .The folk element is a different country for each of the pieces. Titles are ‘Here the Tides Flow’ by Gayle Tapper, ‘Tristeza India’ by Digno Garcia and ‘Vive La Rose’, a old French folk song.</p>

<p>For Children is a cycle of short piano pieces composed by Béla Bartok that represent his research into folk-song he did together with Zoltan Kodaly. These original Hungarian and Slovakian folk songs preserve authentic rhythms and character with transparent and sometimes deceptively simple accompaniments. The collection was originally started in 1908 and completed in 1909, and comprised 85 pieces which were issued in four volumes. They were written as student works, and progress slightly in difficulty through the cycle.</p>
<p>I came across these pieces as a teenager looking for easy pieces to play on the piano, and found a volume of a selection of 32 which many years later I realized would work almost without any changes on 2 guitars. In this form they are still modest pieces and make ideal material for the less talented players but also provide an excellent and stimulating suite of pieces for any players looking for recital material. I hope you enjoy them for their innocence and beauty but especially for their beautiful folk melodies and rhythms.</p>

</div>
<div class="preface">
<p>Aleksandr Porfiryevick Borodin (1833-1887) wrote, amongst other things, a few small works for piano solo, the most extended of which appears to be the Petite Suite from 1885. Consisting of seven movements, it is of moderate difficulty only in its’ original form, and betrays very little pianistic sweep or extended range that makes so many piano works difficult to arrange for guitar players. It has been arranged for other combinations of instruments in the past, Glazunov’s 1889 orchestration of it perhaps being the most famous, although the 6th movement ‘Serenade’ was used as ‘Night of my Nights’, the processional marriage song from ‘Kismet’.</p>
<p>This however appears to be the first time this Borodin composition has been arranged for guitars, a surprising fact in view of its very appealing eastern style of harmony work, very typical of Borodin at his best, and also because it fits almost untouched onto two guitars with very little actual arranging needing to be done.</p>
<p>I hope that this extended work with its’ beguiling melodies and wonderful harmonies will prove popular to any moderately advanced duos.</p>

<p>This is an example of Faure’s later style, with often unusual and sudden harmonic changes that catch the listener unawares, whilst remaining very melodic throughout. Movements are Capriccio, Fantasia, and Fugue in Am, Adagietto, Improvisation, Allegresse, Fugue in Em, and Nocturne.</p>

The six movements of this justly famous suite includes the opening Berceuse, known to many people who otherwise might not necessarily know much classical music. The other movements, Mi–a–ou, Le Jardin de Dolly, Kitty – Valse, Tendresse, and Le Pas Espanol, are every bit as engaging, and make for an extended suite ideal for concert material.

<p>Edvard Hagerup Grieg (15 June 1843 - 4 September 1907) was a Norwegian composer and pianist, widely considered one of the leading Romantic era composers, and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire worldwide. His use and development of Norwegian folk music in his own compositions put the music of Norway in the international spectrum, as well as helping to develop a national identity, much as Jean Sibelius and Antonin Dvorak did in Finland and Bohemia, respectively. Grieg is regarded as simultaneously nationalistic and cosmopolitan in his orientation, for although born in Bergen and buried there, he traveled widely throughout Europe, and considered his music to express both the beauty of Norwegian rural life and the culture of Europe as a whole.</p>
<p>His Lyric Pieces, a collection of 66 short works for solo piano, were published in 10 volumes, from 1867 (Op. 12) to 1901 (Op. 71) The entire collection includes several of his best known pieces, such as Wedding Day at Troldhaugen, To Spring, March of the Trolls and Butterfly to name but four. Opus 12 consists of 8 modest sized pieces (they would get bigger and more ambitious as the sets progressed) ranging from the opening Arietta, to which he returned 44 years later when writing the ﬁnal work of op. 71, Remembrances which uses the same thematic material, to the folk style of Norwegisch (No. 6) and the dance elements of Walzer (No. 2), and the Elfentanz (No. 4).</p>
<p>The surprising fact about these 66 Lyric Pieces is how they adapted completely from the piano to the 2 guitars almost without any problem at all. The occasional octave replacement, and the necessity of a key change in a number of the works was unavoidable but almost no actual change to the musical conception was necessary, thus giving the guitarists a very vivid and exact idea of the magic of Grieg's compositions and their inherent beauty and individualism, whilst feeling entirely natural to play on the guitars throughout.</p>

The sixth set, Op. 57 in six movements has Vanished Days, a two — part piece where the sadness of the days gone by in the first minor section, is suddenly replaced by the happiness of the recall of those days in the major section in the middle. There are the delicate harmonies of Illusion, the homage to Danish composer Niels Gade and the quirky waltz — rhythms of She Dances. Finally we have the enigmatic harmonies of Secret and the final piece Home Sickness that follows the same sad — happy — sad structure of the opening piece Vanished Days.</p>

Alongside this are From Early Years, a vibrant waltz, the small but moving Peasant’s Song, the chromatic harmonies of Melancholy, the elegant Salon, and finally the slow and serious Ballad.</p>
<p>The surprising fact about these 66 Lyric Pieces is how they adapted completely from the piano to the 2 guitars almost without any problem at all. The occasional octave replacement, and the necessity of a key change in a number of the works was unavoidable but almost no actual change to the musical conception was necessary, thus giving the guitarists a very vivid and exact idea of the magic of Grieg's compositions and their inherent beauty and individualism, whilst feeling entirely natural to play on the guitars throughout.</p>

<p>Edvard Hagerup Grieg (15 June 1843 - 4 September 1907) was a Norwegian composer and pianist, widely considered one of the leading Romantic era composers, and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire worldwide. His use and development of Norwegian folk music in his own compositions put the music of Norway in the international spectrum, as well as helping to develop a national identity, much as Jean Sibelius and Antonin Dvorak did in Finland and Bohemia, respectively. Grieg is regarded as simultaneously nationalistic and cosmopolitan in his orientation, for although born in Bergen and buried there, he traveled widely throughout Europe, and considered his music to express both the beauty of Norwegian rural life and the culture of Europe as a whole.</p>
<p>His Lyric Pieces a collection of 66 short works for solo piano, were published in 10 volumes, from 1867 (Op. 12) to 1901 (Op. 71) The entire collection includes several of his best known pieces, such as Wedding Day at Troldhaugen, March of the Trolls, To Spring and Butterfly. The six movements of the ninth and penultimate set, Op68 begin with the robust opening march that is the Sailor’s Song, and the delightful tiptoeing of Grandmother’s Minuet. There are the surprising harmony changes in At Thy Feet, and the emotional warmth of By The Cradle. Finally there is the completely original design of Evening in The Mountains, and the gently chromatic harmonies of the final Valse Melancolique.</p>

The seven movements of this tenth and final set vary from the two –part structure of the opening Once Upon a Time, with a slow melodic opening leading to a fast Springtanz section, the  tranquil Summer’s Eve , with its unpredictable harmonies, to the frantic Allegro Molto of Puck. Peace of the Woods has some unusual melodic moments, whilst the Halling (a dance that Grieg returned to several times) bounds along excitingly. The final two movements are Gone, a mournful piece that mostly moves in sad chromatic harmonies, and last of all Remembrances, which is a Waltz version of the very first piece from the opening set of Lyric Pieces Op. 12, the Arietta and serves as a momentary backward glance to all those years ago, when a much younger Grieg began to create these ten suites.</p>

<p>This arrangement has been made from the suite, not the complete ballet and therefore has the famous five movements including the opening Pavane de la Belle au Bois Dormant, and the final Le Jardin Feerique. It goes through a vast range of emotions from mysterious to exhilarating and is a wonderful example of Ravel at his very best.</p>

<p>This is an arrangement of the Orchestral Suite in four movements and is in manuscript form at the present time. The intention is to re-write it in printed form a.s.a.p. It is ideal for the more advanced trio who want something exciting and immediately engaging for their audience.</p>

<p>This is a wonderfully involving work in Ravel’s most immediate yet enigmatically harmonised style. It is set in 23 pages of clearly written manuscript form in score only at the moment, although the intention is to set it down in printed form a.s.a.p., at which point parts will of course become available.</p>
