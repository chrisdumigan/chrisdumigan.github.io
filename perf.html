<h1>Performing</h1>

<p>Chris is a classical guitarist who can provide ideal background music to accompany private functions, parties, restaurant gatherings, birthdays, weddings and other similar functions. His repertoire list consists of over six hours of varied material, more than half of which are his own arrangements of popular songs.</p>

<p>Should you wish to book him, a large portion of repertoire is listed on the site, to give you the chance to request anything you see on the list. Provided you give enough notice, Chris is always willing to arrange songs that aren't on the list, especially for your event.</p>
 
<p>Chris can be booked for any such functions as these for a very reasonable fee, which is mutually negotiated in advance. Please contact Chris for more details.</p>
