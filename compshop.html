<p>Originally written for solo guitar, this work was later expanded for two guitars and was my ﬁrst attempt at this combination. The work is in four movements and is an exercise in an unusual form of variation, or rather one of stark contrasts laid side by side with one another. Therefore each of the movements has two parts, the second of which is a variation of the ﬁrst, but which is almost an opposite of it. The suite gets its name from a style of painting wherein the artist uses such violent contrasts in his canvas.</p>
<p>This work is dedicated to my friend Anne MacCarthy who was the first player to read through this with me, and with whom I gave the first unofficial performance at a Manchester Guitar Circle evening many moons ago.</p>

<p>Dedicated to Scott Bradley who gave its premiere in Carlisle in November 2001, the three linked movements form an extended piece in a very unusual variation form. The first movement is the ‘rhapsodic ‘element and consists of a tightly organized set of themes that eventually in movement three are reiterated in a ‘dance’ styled movement . The middle interlude is a brief oasis of calm, wherein certain themes recur with all their energy dissipated, before the onslaught of the final dance section.</p>

<p>Shenandoah has long been one of my very favourite folk/traditional tunes, and so although I considered arranging it in some way for guitar long ago, I hesitated doing so, because I really wanted to do it justice. Part of the problem was the fact the tune had only one refrain and I was mindful of the old saying that you can do nothing to a folk tune except keep repeating it faster and faster. It was only when I considered providing my own opening melody, by way of an introduction to Shenandoah, did the piece really start developing in my mind.</p>
<p>So here you get an introduction of my own prefacing the actual melody of Shenandoah, followed by a return to the introduction, now acting as a link to the final and slightly varied repeat of the folk melody. Throughout I have used open strings clashing with arpeggiated chords, often in high positions, to create a particular effect that I hope players will find evocative and haunting.</p>

<p>After ‘accidentally’ writing what is now No. 2 in Am and finding it uncharacteristically short, yet absolutely complete thematically and developmentally, I resolved then and there to write a complete set in every key. The main criterion for me was that they should be very short, yet complete in structure with developed themes and material, and moreover individually display a wide range of emotional content and styles. Apart from having to backtrack to write No. 1 next, the remaining 22 were in fact written in the published order.</p>
<p>I hope you find them invigorating and stimulating to play whilst the analysts amongst you might hopefully enjoy their structure and tightly controlled thematic development.</p>

<p>The two- movement structure encompasses a journey from death to life. The first movement is a Lament for those we have loved and lost. It is grief-stricken, and inconsolable until the moment about halfway through the first movement, when our hero has a sudden happy memory of the person or persons lost. The memories get happier and more excited as for a brief moment he forgets his grief and relives the happy time again in his mind, until... suddenly he remembers, and at the happiest moment he is plunged back into the present, and the piece returns to its sombre beginnings.</p>
<p>The second and final movement, in direct contrast to the first is a celebration of the lives to come. After a short linking introduction, which plays around with what is going to be the main theme of the movement proper, one finds oneself in the middle of a huge street party, a celebration to end all celebrations. Imagine for a second an impossible situation wherein the rules of life and death have for a day been suspended and turned inside out. Everybody in the party has been told that they are going to meet their descendants, all the family members due to be born centuries into the future. The whole mood is one of excitement and joy as the party goers await their future family. Then... from the far distance... a procession can be heard and as it gets closer and closer they realise that it is the descendants making their grand entrance. As the procession meets up with the party revellers, everything ends in happiness and optimism.</p>

<p>I wrote these free adaptations of three folk songs, after becoming captivated by a BBC Radio 3 broadcast on the works of Percy Grainger, and particularly his association with, and collection of, folk songs around the turn of the century with the aid of wax cylinder recording equipment. Having loved folk songs for as much as thirty years, I was completely unprepared for the recording made by Grainger in 1908 of Joseph Taylor, a 70 year old Lincolnshire peasant folk singer, singing only two verses he remembered of Brigg Fair. I had no idea how the folk singers had sounded before the broadcast and the shock wave it sent through me, immediately sent me into a buzz of compositional activity.</p>
<p><b><u>Brigg Fair</u></b> was therefore composed first on 9/3/97 and begins and ends with an unharmonised rendition of the melody - the same length and with the same mannerisms that Joseph had used. In between, the tune, or the harmonic structure of it, is always there in the form of a fluid variation which gathers momentum throughout. I then sandwiched it with two more pieces Grainger collected in the field.</p>
<p><b><u>Lisbon</u></b>, composed last on 16/3/97 made me think of a processional which begins the piece and records into the distance at the end.</p>
<p><b><u>Green Bushes</u></b> composed on 14/3/97, sounded very dance-like to me and so I have attempted to bring out those characteristics in it.</p>
<p>The set can and should be played without a pause, as the endings of the first two movements link directly with the beginning of the next.</p>
<p>Throughout, I have produced no ultra modern harmonies, but rather tried to remain true to the basic folk nature of the pieces. They are my tribute to Grainger and his pioneering work, but are in no way his harmonisations - in fact, for from it.</p>
<p>The set is respectfully dedicated to Paul Gregory, who gave the first performance at the Westgate Chapel in Lewes on 6/5/97.</p>
<p><i>Chris Dumigan, December 1997</i></p>
<br>
<p>"I enjoyed this tribute to him (Grainger). The tunes are well defined and there are some expressive moments as well as 'fireworks' in the variations on Green Bushes."<br>
<i>Classical Guitar July 1997, reporting on the first performance.</i></p>
<p>This new engraving of the work is presenting Brigg Fair on only two pages, to avoid a page turn in the piece. The slow character of the piece, therefore, may not be apparent at first glance, due to the 'filled' pages.<br>

<p>This piece is named after my eldest daughter and was written in its original solo form in February 1995 when she was not quite four years old. Its happy uncomplicated structure and melody seemed an ideal piece to name after her.</p>
<p>Five years later I decided to re-write it for guitar duet rather than simply adding a second part to the existing solo version.</p>
<p>Shuko Shibata gave the ﬁrst professional performance of the solo version at Flixton House, Manchester on 30th April 1998, whilst Paul Gregory and Alison Parratt gave the first professional performance of the duet version in the Westgate Chapel, Brighton in 2001.</p>

<p>Written at the behest of the late German musician Norbert Dams, and subsequently fingered and published by his firm Daminus (but unfortunately not played by him), it occupies almost the same ideas as A Moment Alone. Like the soliloquy in a play, this quite extended piece is a musical soliloquy, wherein the performer goes through many ideas, and emotions, as if speaking to an audience and by doing so, is talking through his thoughts and problems to them. Likewise this piece has many sudden emotive outbursts, wherein the main theme goes through many changes before eventually returning to the opening idea, towards its close.</p>

<p>This Sonata was written in April 1974 and is in 3 movements, but was originally conceived in four, the omitted movement becoming my Intermezzo, published separately. As a work of my youth it occurred at a time when my musical inﬂuences were very wide ranging and so if one looks hard enough, one can see that the piece doffs its cap in all number of musical directions.</p>
<p>It begins with a very dance — like Allegretto ﬁrst movement, very much in an English style. The middle movement is really two movements in one. Its first section is slow and expressive with a sudden Scherzo-like Presto in the middle section, but on returning to the opening idea, the theme has moved from major to minor and ends on a tragic note. The ﬁnal movement is a boisterous Rondo which dances to a triumphant conclusion.</p>

<p>This was written after a conversation with Paul Gregory, where we were discussing the fact that Ravel died before fulfilling his promise to Segovia to write a guitar piece. Paul then said maybe I should try and write something in his style. A few months later the Sonatina was completed. Its three movements are full of the Ravellian sound, and indeed the middle movement, marked in the style of a minuet, was seen by Angelo Gilardino who complemented me on absolutely capturing a convincing Ravel sound in it. It was he who suggested a surrounding pair of movements, and it was his company Berben of Italy who then published the piece. It was premiered by Paul Gregory at the Fairfield Halls in Croydon in May 2004.</p>

<p>This six-movement suite started out life as a suite for 10-course Renaissance lute, completed in September 1985 and originally requested by a friend who wanted some modern lute music for a project he was about to start. The project subsequently never came to life, but by then the piece had been written. And so it lay fallow for a few years until in September 1994 I realized that if one tuned the guitar string 3 to F# and raised a very few bass notes up an octave, that the entire piece was playable on the guitar with little difference.</p>
<p>The style is a deliberate mixture of Renaissance and modern folk harmonies, as I do find a correlation between the two and each of the six movements has a florid title dedicated to each of the members of my immediate family, in the manner of the lute music of old.</p>

<p>This was my first set of pieces for the classical guitar, which were completed on 15th December 1973. At the time my musical influences were many and varied but included folk music and singer-songwriter artistes such as David Crosby, James Taylor, Paul Simon and Elton John, but also latin-american composers for the guitar such as Villa Lobos, Ponce, Lauro and many others too numerous to mention. So what came out from this heady mix was a very popular style of guitar music with feet in both camps.</p>
<p>Over the years I have added and subtracted various minor bits, usually involving the odd rhythm change here and there, but here it is presented as it was originally written all those years ago. Any good players will probably change the odd detail here and there anyway, so I leave that entirely up to you to do as you see fit.</p>
<p>A number of performances have taken place in The Manchester area from The 1970s onwards, and The official London premiere was given by Galina Vale in January 1999.</p>

<p><b>Intermezzo for solo guitar</b><br>
This little single movement piece was written in April 1974 and began life as one of the middle two movements in my Sonata for solo guitar (published separately), until I realised that stylistically it did not quite fit in with that work. Therefore I decided that the movement was too good to lose completely and hope the players amongst you will enjoy having a go at!</p>
<p><b>A Fireside Scene</b><br>
This little single movement was written in March 1974 and started out life as my trying to write a piece of programme music. So I imagined a grandfather in front of a warm fire preparing to read an exciting and magical tale to his grandson (or granddaughter), which is the opening 20 bars which acts as a scene-setting type of idea. Then... we’re off! and he begins his magical tale with his excited grandchild listening with wide eyes to his fantastic story. This is the Allegretto section beginning at bar 21 and the main body of the piece. One can hear little remnants of Russian/Arabian music in the manner of Scheherazade in some of the harmonies which might give the listener/player a little clue as to what the story might be about! The slow introduction then returns and the whole story obviously finishes off in a mysterious stillness with a little ‘ping’ on a high harmonic.</p>

<div class="preface">
<p>This piece started out as just my version of 'She Moved Through the Fair', without the variations tag, as I had known the melody for several years and yet had not actually committed an arrangement to paper. I arrived to the coda of what is now bar 23, before I realised that my next idea was moving away from the actual melody. It was the old problem with a folk tune that you can't do anything to it other than go faster and louder rearing its head again. It was at that moment that I went back to the title, added the words 'Variations on...' before continuing.</p>
<p>Very little fingering is given here as I feel that there are few, if any, places where my musical intentions could be misconstrued. I have included various slurs along the way but realise that players may want to put others in if they want more flexibility and fluidity of sound.</p>

<p>This piece was originally completed on 23rd January 1989. As you will find out, it is very English - Pastoral in style with several contrasting sections. It stayed like that for a few years in spite of a slight nagging doubt in my mind with regard to the length of the central slow section, which I thought was too short but could not see how to amend it. On 6th July 1994, I added 23 further bars into this section thus making the much improved version you now have in front of you.</p>

<p>This piece was written at the request of Paul Gregory for his trio, Triptico, to play. It was completed on 30th July 1997 and premiered by Triptico on May 13th 1998 at Brighton College during the Brighton Festival.</p>
<p>The title Lifedance had been with me for a while, as Dance of Life, but nothing happened until I came to write this piece. It is in two joined sections, the first of which begins very mysteriously with a deliberately clashing idea, which re-occurs throughout the first section. It attempts to describe the struggle for life, in all its’ forms, even perhaps primeval life, hence the references to ‘like a groan’ and ‘slithering’. The ‘struggle’ is hard fought, as can be witnessed by the various climaxes and subsequent relapses, until the final climax on the huge E major ‘chord that brings the section to an end, but not without the underlying musical crunches that still occur under the main action right to the end. The second section concerns itself with the joy of life, and is basically a dance of optimism. So therefore the two parts represent the negative and the positive sides of life, one the mirror image of the other, but being the eternal optimist that I am, the good wins through at the end.</p>
<p>This work is respectfully dedicated to Triptico, who are Paul Gregory, Alison Parratt and Brian Ashworth, with grateful thanks.</p>

<p>The Sonatina for two guitars is my second work written for this medium. It is very English in style and begins with an introductory theme that pervades the whole work, returning at the heart of the climax of the ﬁnal movement. The first movement goes through many emotions, but begins with a four part textured theme that might remind one of the hustle and bustle of some baroque works, before becoming in succession, more dance-like (its' second theme) and more lyrical (the second theme's continuation). A return to the first theme brings on a mysterious rocking theme which takes the place of the development section but is in itself considerably developed before heralding a climactic and much changed return to the introduction. A final play through the first theme leads into the sudden rush of the coda.</p>
<p>The second movement is in two main parts, the first a haunting folk-like minor key melody in 5/4 and the second an exotically harmonised major key idea. The final movement is a gig-like dance in 12/8 and 15/8 with a very optimistic feel. and has a haunting, enigmatic section in the middle of the movement which hopefully catches the listener unawares. A final return to the dance leads directly to a climactic return to the introduction of the first movement. which in turn becomes the final coda.</p>
<p>The duration is approximately 17 minutes and the first performance was given by Ann McCarthy and myself at the Manchester Guitar Circle (England) in 1996.</p>

<p>This three-movement work was originally written for Chris’ group Acoustic Moods, where the line-up was Classical guitar, acoustic guitar, and 6 string bass guitar, in which form it was played by them many times. As the piece was virtuosic throughout, Chris subsequently decided to re-arrange the piece for a guitar orchestra consisting of one Terz guitar part, four standard guitar parts, and a bass guitar part, to spread the difficulty load somewhat, and furthermore to give other players a chance to try this extroverted piece.</p>

<p>I have always loved the Grand Waltz, as composed by Tchaikovsky and many others too numerous to mention, and had it in the back of my mind to one day compose something of that order on the guitar. When I am away from home, I take manuscript paper to sketch ideas down, without the guitar in hand. One day the first couple of pages of the first movement appeared without my having any idea what I was doing with it. So once the deed was done, I carried on to produce what you are now looking at. It is a tribute to the waltz in all its’ forms and many variations. So in the ﬁrst movement you get a slightly Latin-American feel to the first idea, with its’ cross rhythms and chromaticisms. In the second movement you get the slow romantic waltz, as a first theme, with a Chopinesque idea as the centre. For the last movement you get the slightly Tchaikovskian idea that is the first theme before a little of Dumigan appears at bar 81 in that rather English sounding section. Having said all that, the idea was to produce a melodic set which would be fun to play and listen to, and which doffed its’ cap towards previous waltzes and their composers. I hope to that extent that I have achieved this. This set was first performed by The Guitar Duo — Paul Gregory and Alison Parratt at Westgate Chapel, Lewes on 5th April 2000 and as such is respectfully dedicated to them both with my grateful thanks.</p>

<p>The Aubade was written as a result of my contacting Andrea Forderreuter, guitarist of TrioConBrio. I had previously written 'Pastorale and Dance' for the combination of flute, viola and guitar on the instigation of Paul Gregory in 1998 and had been fortunate enough to hear it premiered on 9th June 1999 by his trio 'In Company’. As Andrea had a similar lineup in her trio, I asked her would she like to see the work and she kindly agreed and then commenced playing it in June 2015. I then suggested I might write a brand-new piece for them, and Andrea surprised me with the suggestion that the Pastorale and Dance, a slow-fast combination, would benefit from a fast opening movement in the same 'Celtic' style to create a fast-slow-fast piece. As the original pair were in fact based on the same melody but varied, | commenced writing this opening piece again basing it on the same theme, and as a result the Aubade was created in October 2015, and premiered by TrioConBrio in January 2016. So my huge thanks go to Andrea, Christina Singer (flute) and Lydia Bach (viola) for doing such a fabulous job with it!</p>

<p>The quintet is set in five movements and was completed in March 2002. Considering it takes more than 30 minutes to play it was written on a whim! I had previously written works for all combinations of the instruments in this Quintet, but never put them all together in one work, so I set out to do just that. To my knowledge it has never been performed as yet.</p>
<p>After the sunny disposition of the opening movement, the Scherzo is almost manic, with a deliberately heavily accented rhythm. There is then a contrasting trio section before the opening Scherzo returns. The middle movement, Adagio, is mournful and desolate and a huge contrast to what has gone before. The Waltz that follows is never the friendly dance you might be expecting but rather a wild swirling nightmare reminiscent of a carousel ride gone wrong. The joyful Rondo - Finale has some interesting time signatures and cross rhythms and is both effervescent and optimistic. In the very final moments of the piece, the opening melody from the first movement enters to close the work fortissimo.</p>

<p>The Sonatina consists of three movements, Festal Dance, Intermezzo, and Jig and Processional. It was written for Craig Ogden and his percussion partner Paul Tanner at the end of 2000 when Craig commented that there was very little written for them to play on their forthcoming tour as Ogden—Tanner. As a result I set about the challenge, writing the percussion part for Vibraphone and Marimba. The two outer movements are Jig based, with the middle Intermezzo having a very Jazzy feel with lush harmonic sequences.</p>
<p>It lasts for 21 minutes and was performed by Ogden—Tanner on a number of occasions including one at my home town, Manchester UK, at the Bridgewater Hall, and several in Australia including a Sunday Live broadcast on Australian Classic FM in November 2001.</p>
